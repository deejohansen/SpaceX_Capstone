Capstone Project for IBM Data Science Professional Certificate

SpaceX is an American aerospace company that claims that their Falcon 9 Rocket can not only carry payloads to the Earth’s Orbit, but that the first stage of this rocket can land and be reused. If true, this is a huge cost savings that they can pass onto their customers. They advertise that their Falcon 9 rocket launches cost 62 million dollars while other providers cost upwards of 165 million dollars each. The purpose of this research is to determine the factors that improve the success rate of the Falcon 9’s stage one landing and to consider if this success rate is high enough for SpaceX to make this claim.

I will collect and clean the data and analyze it with SQL and visualizations.  Then I will futher analyze the data with Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), Visulations using Folium and Dashboards, and then use Predictive Analytics to determine predictive success rates. This analysis will hellp determine if is tryly feasable for SpaceX to reuse it Falcon 9 Stage One boosters.
