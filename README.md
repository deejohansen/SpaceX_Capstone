# SpaceYCapstone
Capstone Project for IBM Data Science Professional Certificate

This capstone project will determine the price of each rocket launch for a new (make-believe) commercial space company named SpaceY.  I will create dashboards for the team, determine if SpaceY will reuse the first stage or not. I will also train a maching learning model by using public infor to predict if SpaceY will resuse its first stage or not.
